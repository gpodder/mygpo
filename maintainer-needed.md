Maintainer for gpodder.net needed
=================================


What's gpodder.net?
-------------------

gpodder.net is a podcast directory with interfaces for podcasting
applications integration. All the source code required for running gpodder.net is open
source.


Why is a new maintainer needed?
-------------------------------

Some effort is required to keep the website and web service running and
up-to-date. I (the current maintainer) for now have enough time to keep the system up
and running, but no time to do improvements and other development.

What requirements are there to a new maintainer?
------------------------------------------------

* Python knowledge
* Basic understanding of web technologies
* Basic understanding of relational databases

What are the tasks?
-------------------

* developing new features
* keeping the system up and running 
* responding to bug reports
* fixing bugs

What do you gain from maintaining gpodder.net?
----------------------------------------------

* You gain experience in an ecosystem of web services and apps
* You are going to have the first-hand experience of running a web service, with all
  pitfalls that can't be learned by theory alone
* You cooperate with other experienced developers in the podcasting world


Who pays for running gpodder.net?
---------------------------------

Currently, the external operating costs for gpodder.net are limited to the
domain. Hosting is donated by prgmr.com. There are occasional donations from
users to compensate for the expenses. There have been occasional requests for
running ads on the site, but these have mostly been turned down.


How would the handover happen?
----------------------------

I imagine a handover period of several months, with a gradual transition of
access and duties. This would be accompanied by an explanation of code and
infrastructure.

I reserve the right to cancel the handover if I deem necessary.


What if there is no new maintainer?
-----------------------------------

If no new maintainer can be found, gpodder.net most likely going to be shut down by the
end of 2019.


Interested?
